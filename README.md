## Project Proposal
> _**PWM Drawer with Real-Time Display on Graphical LCD**_

### Project Overview:

The PWM Drawer project aims to develop a real-time PWM signal measurement and visualization tool. The system will capture PWM signals using hardware input capture, calculate the PWM frequency and duty cycle, and display the waveform in real time on a graphical LCD. This project will provide valuable insights into PWM signals' characteristics and allow users to observe and analyze PWM waveforms quickly and accurately.

### _Features:_

1. Hardware Input Capture: Utilize the hardware input capture capability of the ATmega32 (AVR) microcontroller to accurately measure the PWM signal pulse width and calculate the frequency.
2. Graphical LCD Interface: Interface with a graphical LCD (e.g., ST7735, SSD1306) using a suitable graphical LCD library (e.g., u8g2) to draw real-time PWM waveforms.
3. Real-Time Display: Continuously update the graphical LCD with the latest PWM measurements, providing real-time visualization of the PWM waveform.
4. Frequency and Duty Cycle Calculation: Implement algorithms to calculate the PWM frequency and duty cycle based on the captured pulse width.
5. User Interface: Develop a user interface to control the PWM measurements and display settings. Use buttons or a touchscreen to start/stop measurements, switch between PWM channels, and adjust display parameters.
6. Data Logging (Optional): Add an optional feature to log captured PWM data to external storage (e.g., SD card) for further analysis or export to a computer.
